# Popeye README

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exercise designed to teach Docker and Docker Compose through a practical, hands-on approach. It involves deploying a web polling application that integrates various components including a Flask Python web application, a Redis queue, a Java application for processing votes, a PostgreSQL database for storage, and a Node.js application for displaying results.

## Features
- **Containerization**: Learn how to containerize applications using Docker.
- **Docker Compose**: Master the orchestration of multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Understand the basics of microservices architecture through practical implementation.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configure applications using environment variables.

## Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Python, Java, and Node.js.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.

## Usage
- Access the Flask web application to cast votes.
- Monitor the queue in Redis.
- Check processed votes in the PostgreSQL database.
- View voting results through the Node.js application.
